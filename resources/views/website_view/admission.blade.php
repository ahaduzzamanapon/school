                        interests, and fit with the school’s values and culture.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Admission Process:</strong></p>

                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Application Submission:</strong>Parents or guardians complete and submit the
                        application form, along with all required documents, to the school’s admissions office by the
                        specified deadline.</li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Review and Evaluation:</strong>The school’s admissions committee or personnel
                        reviews the applications, documents, and assessments to determine eligibility and evaluate the
                        student’s suitability for the school.</li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Notification:</strong>Once the review process is complete, the school informs
                        parents of the admission decision. This notification may be in the form of an acceptance letter,
                        rejection letter, or placement on a waitlist.</li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Acceptance and Enrollment:</strong> If the student is accepted, parents must
                        complete the enrollment process, which typically involves paying fees, signing enrollment contracts,
                        and submitting additional required documents.</li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Orientation:</strong>New students and their parents may be invited to attend
                        an orientation session to become familiar with the school’s policies, procedures, and facilities.
                    </li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Transition Planning:</strong> For students transitioning from one grade to
                        another, the school may work with parents to ensure a smooth transition, which may include placement
                        testing or academic counseling.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It’s important to note that admission requirements and processes can vary widely between schools,
                    so it’s essential for parents to carefully review the specific guidelines and deadlines provided by
                    the school they are interested in. Additionally, international schools or schools with specialized
                    programs may have unique admission criteria and procedures.</p>
